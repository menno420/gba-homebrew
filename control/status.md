## Day ledger 2026-07-15 (pointers)

- Wickroad growth cuts 1–5 merged: #142–#146 (dist/wickroad.gba v0.6,
  sha256 `92df5c91...0947`).
- Current-state reconcile merged: #147 (docs/current-state.md).
- Merge-automation verification probe merged: #148.
- Pages deploy workflow merged: #149 — but deploy-pages.yml has ZERO runs;
  owner manual dispatch pending.
- Owner decision menu merged: #150 → docs/NEXT-MENU-2026-07-15.md
  (awaiting the owner's letter; in-doc rec B1).

## Parked

- No open PRs in this repo at close (this heartbeat PR excepted).

## ⚑ needs-owner (pointers; detail lives in the PR #149 body + docs/NEXT-MENU-2026-07-15.md)

1. Menu letter for the next arc (docs/NEXT-MENU-2026-07-15.md).
2. Arcade go-live: Settings → Pages → Source "GitHub Actions", then
   Actions → "Deploy web arcade to Pages" → Run workflow → main.
3. nds-rom-build is not in the branch-protection required checks.

## next-2-tasks baton

1. Dispatch the owner's menu letter as the chosen arc's cut 1.
2. After the arcade clicks, verify the Pages run green and
   https://menno420.github.io/gba-homebrew/ loads.

## Dispatched slice 2026-07-16 — current-state rows (append-only)

- updated: 2026-07-16T01:13:55Z (`date -u`); session card
  `.sessions/2026-07-16-current-state-rows.md`, branch
  `claude/current-state-rows`, PR #152.
- What: docs/current-state.md reconciled against the live GitHub PR
  list at HEAD `d38887c` — the stale In-flight NEXT-MENU row resolved
  (merged as #150, `588aa4e`, 2026-07-15T21:42:05Z) and the shipped
  ledger carried through #148–#151 with merge SHAs + merged_at from
  the live API. Docs-only; no dist/, no workflows, no routines touched.
- ORDER 007 ack check: the done-when ack IS on record — "ORDER 007
  ACKNOWLEDGED (first rebooted dispatch)" landed in control/status.md
  at `df55299` (#142, 2026-07-15); no re-ack needed here.

## Dispatched slice 2026-07-16 — gate-red orphan fix (append-only)

- updated: 2026-07-16T01:31:56Z (`date -u`); session card
  `.sessions/2026-07-16-gate-orphan-fix.md`, branch
  `claude/gate-orphan-fix` (DRAFT PR for owner review).
- What: `python3 bootstrap.py check --strict` was red on main since
  #151 (`d38887c`) — condensing this file dropped the only links into
  docs/eap-closeout-walkthrough-2026-07-14.md and
  docs/concepts/session-1-concepts.md, transitively orphaning 3 more
  docs (5 `[reachable]` findings; the check passed at `588aa4e`).
  Fix: a "Doc index" section in docs/current-state.md (a
  `readpath_docs` reachability root per substrate.config.json) linking
  the 5 docs — this file was NOT rewritten. Also retired the served
  claim control/claims/claude-current-state-rows.md (its work merged
  as #152, `478bf16`, 2026-07-16T01:20:02Z). Docs-only; no dist/, no
  workflows, no routines, no merge automation touched.
